# 3d render test
Using weak projection to achieve 3d images.  

## Weak Projection
`(x*fov)/z+fov`
Its used to calculate a 3d point using some `x` and `y` coordinates, and adjusting the "distance within the world" with a `z` component.  
The `fov` is the camera distance.

 
Rotate using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or enter to see the full rotation
